# goHome

An app that takes you home!

The purpose of the application is to help people who are used to drinking a lot and want to feel safe if they are drunk.

The application currently supports two features, with the prospect of supporting more. 
Navigating through google maps to return the user to the home and sending a message to emergency contacts!


Initially the user is asked to set his home address. Then the user inputs the phones of people he trusts
so that a message will be sent to their cell phone in case of need. 
Once the above parameters have been defined, the application has a button that the user uses 
when he is drunk and can not navigate and sends the message automatically to his contacts while 
opening the navigation to find his way home.
