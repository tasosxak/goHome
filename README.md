# Go Home !


An app that takes you home!

The purpose of the application is to help people who are used to drinking a lot and want to feel safe when they are drunk.

The application currently supports two features, with the prospect of supporting more. 
These are:
  - Navigating through google maps to return the user to the home
  - sending a message to emergency contacts!


Initially the user is asked to set his home address. Then the user inputs the phones of people he trusts
so that a message will be sent to their cell phone in case of need. 

Once the above parameters have been defined, the application has a button that the user uses 
when he is drunk and can't return home. The app automatically sends the message to his contacts while 
opening the navigation to find his/her way home.

Future plans:

  - Analyze user's behavior to automatically activate some emergency actions
  - Extending this app for users with special needs (alzheimer)
  - Utilities for children when they get lost
  - Connecting the app with means of public transport, so that e.g. a taxi can drive the user home
  
  
Thanks for the great event !!!
